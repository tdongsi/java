 * A sequence of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between 
 * successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. 
 * The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. 
 * A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a zig-zag sequence.
 * 
 * Given a sequence of integers, sequence, return the length of the longest subsequence of sequence that is a zig-zag sequence.
 * 
 * Problem constraints:
-	sequence contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-	Each element of sequence is between 1 and 1000, inclusive

# Interactive Java applications/applets

This Java project is my works in 2004 Vacation Internship Program (VIP), using then-new Java 1.4. It contains several interactive Java applications/applets that demonstrate Electrical Engineering concepts.

## Transformer

In this project, the interactive application shows the relationship of the two alternating currents (AC) voltage on the two sides of an ideal transformer.

A user can change the primary and secondary windings as well as the primary (input) voltage.

The AC current is animated in application.

## Lenz's Law

In this project, an interactive application visually demonstrates the Lenz's law.

The magnet can be interactively dragged around to generate the electrical current.

## Filters

In this project, an interactive application demonstrates different passive analog filters, namely lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop filters. Check out the first picture below to refresh your Electrical Engineering knowledge.

Using this Java application/applet, one can:
* select different passive analog filters (e.g., lowpass, bandpass) and immediately see each filter's effect on input.
* manipulate phase and magnitude of a few harmonic components to create different input wave.
* OR use pre-programmed special periodic waves such as square and sawtooth waves.
* adjust the base frequency and see its effect on output wave.
* adjust the parameters of the filter circuit, namely resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the circuit.
* see the computed characteristic frequency and see its effect on the filter output.

## Direct Current (DC) Motor

In this project, a simple DC motor circuit is shown.

The electric current's direction can be changed.

## Energy Flow of a DC Motor Circuit

In this project, the components of power/energy loss in different DC motor circuit configurations (e.g., shunt, series) are shown.

NOTE: The animation is done using Adobe (then Macromedia) Flash instead of Java. The fla source file and supporting image files are checked in here for record.

The project is done near the end of the three-month internship, when I was able to convince my supervising professor that using Flash is better for such a animation-heavy project and took the risk to complete it.

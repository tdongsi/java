# Interactive Java applications/applets

This Java project is my works in 2004 Vacation Internship Program (VIP), using then-new Java 1.4. It contains several interactive Java applications/applets that demonstrate Electrical Engineering concepts.

## Transformer

In this project, the interactive application shows the relationship of the two alternating currents (AC) voltage on the two sides of an ideal transformer.

A user can change the primary and secondary windings as well as the primary (input) voltage.

The AC current is animated in application.

## Lenz's Law

In this project, an interactive application visually demonstrates the Lenz's law.

The magnet can be interactively dragged around to generate the electrical current.

## Direct Current (DC) Motor

In this project, a simple DC motor circuit is shown.

The electric current's direction can be changed.

## Energy Flow of a DC Motor Circuit

In this project, the components of power/energy loss in different DC motor circuit configurations (e.g., shunt, series) are shown.
The animation is done using Adobe (then Macromedia) Flash instead of Java. The fla source file and supporting image files are checked in here for record.
The project is done near the end of the three-month internship, when I was convinced that using Flash is better for such a animation-heavy project and took the risk to complete it.

For **timed** programming tests, new test-takers usually underestimate how short two and a half hours can be.
Remember that 30 minutes of that will go into reading the problem instructions and another 10 to 30 minutes go into setting up before you can start writing the first line of code.
And if you are unlucky, you need another 15-30 minutes to debug any issue that comes up. 
That leaves you only about one hour for actually solving the problem. 
Most of the test takers are experienced and skilled programmers, but they tend to forget that many of those steps above are not needed in their everyday tasks, in their daily environments and routines.

This post lists out steps to get started quickly for a **Java** programming test, using Eclipse and Maven.

(1) Use this command to setup an Eclipse empty project.

``` plain Create an Eclipse project
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=my.interview -DartifactId=CompanyName -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

(2) In Eclipse, go to File > Import > Existing Maven Project. Import the Eclipse project created above.

(3) Update pom.xml for "Executable jar file" + "specified Java version". Replace `my.interview.CompanyName` with the correct name of your main class.

``` xml Add this into pom.xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>attached</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <configuration>
                            <descriptorRefs>
                                <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
                            </descriptorRefs>
                            <archive>
                                <manifest>
                                    <mainClass>my.interview.CompanyName</mainClass>
                                </manifest>
                            </archive>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.7</source>
                    <target>1.7</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

(4) Add logging. Ability to use logging frameworks shows off your skill and experience. 
More importantly, it allows you to liberally print lots of information needed for debugging without worrying about cleaning up console output later.

* Create `resources` source folder in `src/main`.
* Add `log4j.properties`. For simplicity, only log information to console. 
    * Use `logger.debug` for printing debug information and turn on/off logging by setting `rootLogger` to `DEBUG`/`INFO`.
* You need to add into `pom.xml` dependencies for the three followings: `slf4j-api` (interface), `slf4j-log4j12` (route slf4j calls to log4j), `log4j` (logging backend).

Use the following content for `log4j.properties`, modified from [this example](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html).

``` java log4j.properties file
# Set root logger level to DEBUG and its only appender to A1.
log4j.rootLogger= INFO, A1

# A1 is set to be a ConsoleAppender.
log4j.appender.A1= org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender

# A1 uses PatternLayout.
log4j.appender.A1.layout= org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern= [%t][%-5p][%c] - %m%n
```
(5) At the end, your `pom.xml` shoulld looks like [this](https://github.com/tdongsi/bart-parking/blob/f8511604bafa4564c468f952ca2fce1452f6a097/java/bart/pom.xml). Check setup.

``` plain Check running
mvn clean package
java -jar target/xxx-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

(6) Use `StreamEditor` interface for easy testing in Eclipse and CLI.

``` java StreamEditor interface
public interface StreamEditor {
	public void process(InputStream in, PrintStream out);
}
```

``` java Main class calling Solver that implements StreamEditor interface
public class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		InputStream in;
		PrintStream out;
		
		if (args.length == 2) {
			try {
				in = new FileInputStream(new File(args[0]));
				out = new PrintStream(new File(args[1]));
			} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
				System.err.println("Could not find file");
				return;
			}
		} else {
			in = System.in;
			out = System.out;
		}
		
		Solver solver = new Solver();
		solver.process(in, out);
	}
}
```
If the test requires specific input from/output to console or file, it's easy to do it either way. 

``` plain Commands to run when using StreamEditor interface
For console input/output:
java -jar target\xxx-jar-with-dependencies.jar < data\in.txt

For file input/output:
java -jar target\Salesforce-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar data/in.txt data/out.txt
```

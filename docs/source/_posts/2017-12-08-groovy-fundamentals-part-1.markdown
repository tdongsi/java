### Anatomy of Groovy bytecode

There is no requirement of filename matching class name like in Java (e.g., Foo.java for Foo class).
However, the convention is that filesnames with lower cases and underscore are used for script (e.g., hello_world.groovy) and filesnames with camel cases are used for Groovy class (e.g., Foo.groovy for Foo class).
